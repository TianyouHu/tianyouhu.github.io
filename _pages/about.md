I'm currently a master student majoring in **Mechanical Engineering** at **Washington University in St. Louis(WashU)**, expecting to graduate in May 2023. Before joining WashU, I recieved my bachelor's degree majoring in **Vehicle Engineering** from **Chongqing University**, China in 2021.

------
I'm looking for **PhD** or **Research Assistant** position in **Robotics** field. My research interests lies in robotics, computer vision, machine learning, motion planning and signal processing. Please download my C.V. [here](https://tianyouhu.github.io/files/CV.pdf). 

I joined Professor [Yiannis Kantaros'](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Yiannis-Kantaros.html) group at WashU since August 2022. I'm now working on **Vision Based Exploration in Fully Unknown Environment** project. I applied autonomous exploration algorithm on our Turtlebot3 Waffle Pi robot by combining RRT naviation algorithm and Karto SLAM method. Besides this, I applied YOLOv7 on our robot for object detection and depth estimation to obtain distance of specific object. My current work is combing laserscan and YOLO info to obtain position of pedestrian. The next step is predicting pedestrians trajectory based on their behavior.

Please check these demo videos.
