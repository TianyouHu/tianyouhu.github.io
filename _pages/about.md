I'm currently a Software Development Engineer at **Tesla** working on Trip Planner.

------

Before joing Tesla, I was a master student majoring in **Mechanical Engineering** at **Washington University in St. Louis(WashU)**. I worked at [Kantaros Lab](https://sites.wustl.edu/kantaroslab/), supervised by Professor [Yiannis Kantaros'](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Yiannis-Kantaros.html) from Aug 2022 to May 2023 when I was at WashU.

Before that, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree majoring in **Vehicle Engineering** from **Chongqing University**, China in 2021.

I run a Chinese tiktok account with 17k followers. The account name is **I Like Los Angeles**. I love LA so much because it is exactly Los Santos in video game Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). For the past 8 years, I have been devoted all my efforts to live a life of GTA5. I'll try my best to make as much money as I can, then move to Beverly Hills.
